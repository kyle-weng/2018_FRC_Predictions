# 2018 FRC Predictions
I looked at some match data, took some match attributes, and used them to predict winners of matches. Tested on the [Las Vegas regional](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2018nvlv), the [Aerospace Valley regional](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2018caav), and the [Hopper divison](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2018hop).
### Thanks To
* [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com/), the source of all of my data
* [tbapy](https://github.com/frc1418/tbapy), a Python module written by FRC 1418 I used to interface with TBA's API
